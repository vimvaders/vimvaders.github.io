<i>Let's take it from the top</i>

I-II-III

<strong>I</strong> read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh

<strong>I</strong> saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

<strong>I</strong> saw a film today oh boy
<u>The English army had just won the war</u>
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on, machine
